# Michigan-CDC-Subsidy-Calculator
A desktop and mobile CDC Subsidy Calculator.

Calculator available at:  https://jscalc.io/calc/bMQriIY65uC8PeLE

This calculator was designed for QISs to use in the field as a tool to facilitate outreach with unlicensed providers.  The tool enables accurate estimates of CDC subsidy income for providers based on their report of actual child care information.  

Information used to calculate income estimates is gathered for each child in care:  1) Total weekly hours of care and 2) child age category (i.e., less than 30 months or 30+ months).  

A third (and optional) datapoint is entered for each child, the family's flat rate contribution (income-based copay), which is used to generate overall family costs incurred from child care *as well as* demonstrate that reaching a status of "high quality" (3, 4, or 5 Stars) results in the added benefit of zero cost for families.

The document in this repository titled, "Calculator Script", includes all code for gathering input data, processing data, the calculations, and printing of outputs.
